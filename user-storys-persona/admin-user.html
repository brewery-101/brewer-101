			<h2>Interaction flow</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Thomas navigates to the homepage and logs in with the log in input fields.</li>
			<li>The javascript receives the login field input, queries the database for correct encrypted code, and starts a handshake with his computer, passing a session cookie, and redirects to his user page</li>
			<li>Thomas sees that his admin icon has 12 notifications and so he clicks on it to open the admin panel</li>
			<li>the website checks user keys to make sure thomas has admin access and then redirects him to the admin panel</li>
			<li>Thomas receives a list of reported issues and reads through the reporter comment form and tagged posts/reviews in question. He sees a community guideline violation (harassment) and opens the report</li>
			<li>the website receives the request to look at the full report and suite of tools, logs thomas' access to the ticket and redirects him to the ticket resolution page which lists the user details, reporter details, and the post/review in question with additional tools.</li>
			<li>Thomas sees that the post content includes aggressive language and threats of violence, and clicks the BAN HAMMER button on the form.</li>
			<li>The site registers the click and sends a confirmation prompt with rational text box</li>
			<li>Thomas types out the reason for a banning (threats of violence) and presses confirm</li>
			<li>the site amends the key for the post with the rational text box value and thomas' user key, sets the user's status key to Banned which runs a script to set all of their posts and content to hidden, and locks the user out of their account so that it redirects them to a complaint form, and lastly, it sends off a response message to the reporter user with the details from the rational text box and closes the report ticket. this redirects thomas back to the admin panel.</li>
