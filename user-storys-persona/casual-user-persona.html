    <H1>User Story</H1>
    <p>As a casual user, I would like to search for a specific brewery and see where it is located on a map.</p>

</div>

<div class="use case">
    <h1>Use Case</h1>
    <p>Sally just got a call from one of her good friends. They are headed to a local brewery in their town, and would like to know if Sally wants to meet them there. Sally tells her friend that she would like to come, but that she's never heard of or been to the brewery that they are going to. She needs a way to see the brewery on a map to get a better sense of where it is.</p>
    <p>Precondition: Sally is on the brewery app homepage.</p>
    <p>Postcondition: Sally follows the directions to the brewery and meets up with her friends.</p>
    <h1>Interaction Flow</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Sally opens the brewery app.</li>
        <li>On the homepage, sally clicks on the search bar at the top of the page.</li>
        <li>She then enters the name of the brewery where her friends want to meet and presses enter or clicks search.</li>
        <li>The map displays the location of the brewery as a pin.</li>
        <li>Sally clicks on the pin, which then displays the address of the brewery she is looking for, as well as a "get directions" button.</li>
        <li>She clicks the "get directions button, which opens google maps, enters the address, and brings up the directions." </li>
        <li>When she is ready to leave, Sally clicks the "start" button, and follows the directions to the brewery.</li>

    </ul>
